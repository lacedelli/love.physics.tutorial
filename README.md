# love.physics.tutorial
Tests made along the tutorial for the box2D framework found over at https://www.iforce2d.net/b2dtut

Since the original tutorial has all examples in c++ there are bound to be some
radical differences in the way that the original tutorial deals with 
bodies and the way that they are created in this version.

Will I ever make an actual tutorial out of these examples? Hard maybe.
I'd love to help others learn through these exercises, but I would prefer
to become more comfortable with the framework to branch out into tutorials.
